# Free Mattress
> Never pay for a good night's sleep again!


## Info

This iOS app is designed to help you find a free mattress in Denver, Colorado. It serves as a database where images, blurbs and intersections are given pertaining to a free mattress in hopes that they will be made use of, or at least properly disposed of! It utilizes the React Native framework for mobile development, and incorporates the React Navigation library to switch page appearences while still remaining a single page application.

## Technologies
* React Native
* React Navigation Library
* Expo CLI

## Setup and Activation

After cloning the repository, run the following commands to initialize this application:

```
 $ npm install
 $ npm start
 ```
 If Expo CLI is not installed on your machine, the "npm start" command will walk you through it. 
 In addition to Expo CLI, you will also need Xcode or an adjacent simulator in order to run the iOS version of this application.

## Inspiration

The idea for this application came to me when somebody abandon a mattress in the alleyway behind my house. I went on to research the consequences of improper mattress disposal and thought to myself that there must be some sort of use for these. It then turned more into a Craigslist-esque marketplace idea where anybody would have the ability to upload anything, and I aimed to fixated on the rawness of that interface. Primarily, I wanted to see a contrast between a sleek opening screen and a feed of something less presentable just to inject some humor in to the application, as I do strongly feel that this kind of contrast and intention is a rarity in the domain of app development.

## Future Deliverables

As this app is still in development, there are a few features I would love to incorporate in the future:
* Geographic coordinates of exact location on Leaflet or other map technology
* Having the ability to upload an image and create a user posting
* Account features to manage listings
* Authorization for account creation 
* The ability to mark if an item is no longer available
* Other StyleSheet oriented effects and accessories!
